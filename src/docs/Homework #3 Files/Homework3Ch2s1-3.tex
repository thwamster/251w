\underline{proposition:} Let $a, b,$ and $c$ be integers.  If there
exists an integer $d$ such that $d|a$ and $d|b$ but $d\not|c$, then
$ax+by=c$ has no integer solutions for $x$ and $y$.

then there exists a positive integer $b\ge 2$ such that $b|c$ and $b\le
\sqrt{c}$.

\noindent Problem 2.3.8  \vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} Let $q\ge 2$ be a positive integer.  If for
all integers $a$ and $b$, whenever $q|ab$, $q|a$ or $q|b$, then $q$
is prime.
