        \underline{proposition:} Given sets $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, $(A\cap
        B)\times(C\cap D)=(A\times C)\cap(B\times D)$.

    \underline{proposition:} If $I$ is a nonempty set, $\{A_i\}_{i\in
    I}$ is a family of sets indexed by $I$, and $B$ is a set, then
    $B-(\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i)=\bigcup_{i\in I}(B-A_i)$.
