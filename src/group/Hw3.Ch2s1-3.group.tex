\noindent Problem 2.2.4
\vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} If $n$ is an even integer, then $n^2$ is
even.  If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd. [GIVEN]

\vspace{0.4cm}

\fbox{proof} (Direct Proof)

\vspace{0.2cm}

Let $n$ be an even integer.  Then by definition, there exists some
integer $x$ such that $n=2x$.  Thus, $$n^2=(2x)^2=(2x)(2x)=2(2x^2)$$
by the associative and commutative properties of integer
multiplication.  Furthermore, since the integers are closed under
multiplication, $2x^2$ is equal to some integer $s$.  Thus,
$n^2=2s$, which by definition of an even number, implies $n^2$ is
even.

\vspace{0.2cm}

Let $n$ be an odd integer.  By definition of an odd integer, there
exists some integer $k$ such that $n=2k+1$.  Thus,
$$n^2=(2k+1)^2=(2k+1)(2k+1)=4k^2+4k+1$$ by the associative,
commutative, and distributive properties of the integers.
Furthermore, by the distributive property, $4k^2+4k+1=2(2k^2+2k)+1$.
Since the integers are closed under multiplication and addition,
$2k^2+2k=t$ for some integer $t$.  Thus, $n^2=2t+1$, which by
definition of an odd integer, implies $n^2$ is odd. $\blacksquare$

\noindent Problem 2.2.7
\vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} Let $a, b, c,$ and $d$ be integers.  If
$a|b$ and $c|d$ then $ac|bd$. [GIVEN]

\vspace{0.4cm}

\fbox{proof} (Direct Proof)

\vspace{0.2cm}

Suppose $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are integers and that $a|b$ and $c|d$. By
definition of divisibility, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such
that $ax=b$ and $cy=d$.  Thus, by the associative and commutative
properties of integer multiplication, $bd=(ax)(cy)=ac(xy)$. Since
the integers are closed under multiplication, $xy=s$ for some
integer $s$.  Thus, $bd=acs$, which by definition implies $ac|bd$.
$\blacksquare$

\noindent Problem 2.3.2
\vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} If $n$ is an integer and $n^2$ is even,
then $n$ is even. [GIVEN]

\vspace{0.4cm}

\fbox{proof} (Contrapositive)

\vspace{0.2cm} Suppose $n$ is an odd integer. By definition, there
exists an integer $m$ such that $n=2m+1$.  Thus, by the associative,
commutative, and distributive properties,
$n^2=(2m+1)^2=4m^2+4m+1=2(2m^2+2m)+1$. Furthermore, since the
integers are closed under addition and multiplication, $2m^2+2m=s$
for some integer $s$.  Thus, $n^2=2s+1$.  By definition of odd, this
implies $n^2$ is odd.  Thus, by the contrapositive, if $n^2$ is
even, $n$ must be even. $\blacksquare$

\noindent Problem 2.3.4
\vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} If $y$ is a nonzero rational number and $x$
is an irrational number, then $xy$ is irrational. [GIVEN]

\vspace{0.4cm}

\fbox{proof} (Contradiction)

\vspace{0.2cm} Suppose $y$ is a nonzero rational number, $x$ is an
irrational number, and $xy$ is a rational number.  We will show this
leads to a contradiction.  By definition of rational, since $xy$ and
$y$ are rational numbers, there exist integers $m, n, l$ and $d$
such that $xy=\frac{m}{n}$ and $y=\frac{l}{d}$.  Thus,
$$xy=x\frac{l}{d}=\frac{m}{n}.$$  Since $y$ is nonzero, $l\not=0$.  Thus multiplication by $\frac{d}{l}$ is well
defined.  Multiplying both sides of $x\frac{l}{d}=\frac{m}{n}$ by
$\frac{d}{l}$, we find $$x=\frac{m}{n}\frac{d}{l}=\frac{s}{t},$$
where $s=md$ and $t=nl$. Since the integers are closed under
multiplication, $s$ and $t$ are both integers.  This implies $x$ is
a rational number, which contradicts our assumption that $x$ is
irrational. Thus, if $y$ is a nonzero rational number and $x$ is an
irrational number, their product $xy$ is irrational. $\blacksquare$

\noindent Problem 2.3.7
\vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} Let $q\ge 2$ be a positive integer.  If for
all integers $a$ and $b$, whenever $q|ab$, $q|a$ or $q|b$, then
$\sqrt{q}$ is irrational. [GIVEN]

\vspace{0.4cm}

\fbox{proof} (Contradiction)

\vspace{0.2cm} Let $q$ be a positive integer greater than or equal
to 2. Suppose that $\sqrt{q}$ is a rational number, and that for all
integers $a$ and $b$, whenever $q|ab$, $q|a$ or $q|b$. We will show
this leads to a contradiction. By definition of a rational number,
$\sqrt{q}$ can be expressed as $\frac{n}{m}$ where $n$ and $m$ are
integers, and $m\not=0$.  Since $q\not=1$, $m$ and $n$ can be chosen
in such a way that they do not share any common factors. Given
$\sqrt{q}=\frac{n}{m}$ it follows that $q=\frac{n^2}{m^2}$.
Multiplying both sides of this equation by $m^2$, we find
$n^2=qm^2$.  Since the integers are closed under multiplication,
$m^2=s$ for some integer $s$.  Thus, $n^2=qs$, which by definition,
implies $q|n^2$.  By our assumption, since $q|n^2$, $q$ must divide
$n$.  Thus there exists some integer $k$ such that $qk=n$.
Substituting $qk$ in for $n$ in the equation $n^2=qm^2$, and
applying the associative and commutative properties of integer
multiplication, we find $q^2k^2=qm^2$.  By the cancelation law,
$qk^2=m^2.$  Again, by the closure of the integers under
multiplication, there exists some integer $t=k^2$. Thus $qt=m^2$,
which by definition, implies $q|m^2$.  By our assumptions, $q$ must
also divide $m$. Thus, $q$ is a common factor of $m$ and $n$, which
contradicts the fact that $m$ and $n$ were chosen to have no common
factors. Therefore, if for all integers $a$ and $b$, when $q|ab$,
$q|a$ or $q|b$, then $\sqrt{q}$ must be irrational. $\blacksquare$
