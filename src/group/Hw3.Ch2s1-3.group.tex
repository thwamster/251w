    \noindent Problem 2.3.6
    \vspace{0.3cm}

    \underline{proposition:} If $c\ge 2$ is a composite integer, then there exists a positive integer $b\ge 2$ such that $b|c$ and $b\le
    \sqrt{c}$.

    \vspace{0.3cm}
    \fbox{proof} (Direct)
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    Let $c$ be an arbitrary composite integer so that $c \geq 2$.
    By the properties of composite integers, let $b$ and $q$ be particular integers so that $2 \leq b \leq q < c$ and $bq = c$.
    In this case, $b$ and $q$ are both factors of $c$, and if $b$ and $q$ are not equal, we let $b$ be the smaller factor.
    By the properties of integer divisibility, we see $b | c$.
    We have seen $b \leq q$.
    By multiplying each side of the inequality by $b$, we see $b^2 \leq qb$.
    By substitution, we see $b^2 \leq c$.
    By taking the square root each side of the inequality, we see $b \leq \sqrt{c}$.
    Therefore, for all composite integers $c$ so that $c \geq 2$, there exists an integer $b$ so that $b \geq 2$, $b | c$, and $b \leq \sqrt{c}$.
    $\blacksquare$
