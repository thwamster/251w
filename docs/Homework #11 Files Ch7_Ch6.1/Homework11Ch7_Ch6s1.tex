\noindent Problem 7.2.3  \vspace{0.3cm} 

 Let $A$ be a set.  Define the binary operation $\triangle$ on $\mathcal{P}(A)$ by $X\triangle Y=(X-Y)\cup(Y-X)$ for all $X,Y\in \mathcal{P}(A).$  This operation is called the symmetric difference.

\underline{proposition:}  The set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ with the operation $\triangle$ forms an abelian group.

\begin{definition} Given groups $(G,\star)$ and $(H,\cdot)$ a map $f:G\rightarrow H$ is called a \emph{group homomorphism} if and only if it is operation preserving, meaning that for all $a,b\in G, f(a\star b)=f(a)\cdot f(b).$  A bijective group homomorphism is called an \emph{isomorphism.}

\noindent Problem 7.3.7  \vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:}  Let $(G,\star), (H,\cdot)$, and $(K,+)$ be groups, and let $f:G\rightarrow H$ and $j:H\rightarrow K$ be isomorphisms.  Then the map $j\circ f:G\rightarrow K$ is an isomorphism.  (You may cite previously proven results about the composition of bijective functions in your proof without proving them again).

\noindent Problem 7.Awesome  \vspace{0.3cm}


\underline{proposition:} Define a relation $\mathcal{I}$ on the set of all groups by saying two groups are related (or isomorphic) if there exists an isomorphism from one to the other.  Prove this is an equivalence relation on the set of all groups.

\noindent Problem 6.1.6:  Prove the following \vspace{0.3cm}

\underline{proposition:} Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets such that $|A|=|B|$.  Given a function $f:A\rightarrow B$, prove $f$ is injective iff $f$ is surjective.  
\vspace{0.2cm}

\fbox{proof:} 
\vspace{1cm}

Note: This result implies that for $f:A\rightarrow B$, if $|A|=|B|,$ the following are equivalent:
$f$ is bijective $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is injective $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is surjective.
